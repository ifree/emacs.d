* My emacs configuration

  This is my emacs configuration which aims at modular and works for different environment. 

** Environment definition

   You can define your environment like
   
   #+begin_elisp 
   (custom-environment-define
     "common"
     :based-on "base"
     :modules '(lisp
                blogging
                company
                cpp)
     :exclude-modules '(android clojure))
   #+end_elisp

   And set environment variable =EMACS-ENV-NAME-LIST= to load target Envs.

** Module difinition

   Each elisp file that starts with "init-" inside modules directory treats as a module.

** Notes
   
   This configuration was inspired by [[https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d][Purcell's]] and some useful modules are copied from it.
